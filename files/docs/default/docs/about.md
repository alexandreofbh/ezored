# About

Ezored is a C++ multi-platform toolkit template.

Ezored philosophy is: write once and compile anywhere.

When you need add native code to your mobile or desktop application Ezored is your best option because it is ready for it and ready for production without any efforts.

You can "plug" the native code into a new or existing mobile or desktop application.

And don't need write your entire mobile or desktop application in C++, but "plug" only the part that you want write in C++ code.

A good example is when you have a sensive code in Swift or Kotlin (or any other language and platform) that you need write in a native code (C/C++) and call only this native function because is more secure and have a better performance than original language.

Since it is a toolkit template for your project, after download Ezored you need upload to your repository because all C++ code will only make sense to your project after it.

You can use it for free, for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

Feel free to collaborate with Ezored, creating or improving the main project or modules.
